# PRBX Travel Mode Identification

**Travel Mode Identification Based on GPS Trajectory Data** — referred to as **PRBX** — is my dissertation project, completed as part of my Computer Science degree. This project accounted for 40 credits and achieved a final score of **59%**.

## Executive Summary

The aim of this project was to investigate machine learning methods 
that can be used in conjunction with labelled GPS data to determine 
the travel mode of a person. After extracting and filtering the GPS data 
5 different travel modes present, those being: walk, cycle, car, bus, 
and train.
The machine learning models selected for this project were decision 
trees, support vector machines and convoluted neural networks. 
These 3 techniques all provide differing approaches to machine 
learning allowing for a wide range of techniques to be used, and for a 
higher likelihood of a model that produces strong results for this 
particular classification task to be found.
In this investigation, different versions of the dataset were used to test 
how well each model performed when there were inconsistencies in 
the data. It was found that the decision tree and convoluted neural 
network were able to achieve the highest accuracies, obtaining up to 
81.1% and 82.6% respectively.
