# PRBX Travel Mode Identification

**Travel Mode Identification Based on GPS Trajectory Data** — referred to as **PRBX** — is my dissertation project, completed as part of my Computer Science degree. This project accounted for 40 credits and achieved a final score of **59%**.

The primary focus of this project is to identify and classify travel modes (such as walking, cycling, or driving) using GPS trajectory data. It explores methods for data processing, feature extraction, and model development within the domain of transportation and mobility studies.
